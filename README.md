## Learning Goals

As this application was built during Phase 1 of the Flatiron School's Software Engineering program, our primary goal was to continue learning. Focus of this project was to develop JavaScript fundamentals and utilize an API.

## Purpose

Aside from learning more in Ruby, Sinatra, and React, a goal was to create a useful application for other students currently enrolled in the Flatiron School. Many students frequent Flatiron slack channels requesting assistance for various lab assignments they are stuck on. A greater need for a more organized method of requesting assistance seemed to be present and we decided to address the issue together.


## Project Planning

- Frontend : As far as the frontend development goes, we had several goals in mind:
  - The user can see a collection of cocktails and their respective recipes. 
  - The user can click to see a single, mystery cocktail and recipe.
  - The user can upload a recipe of their own.
  - The user can click to like a recipe and increase the like count
  - The frontend will be live and hosted using Github Pages.

- Logo/ Branding Design
  - Design a banner logo
  - Design a "hero" bottle logo
